# ZAMM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/amosjyng/zamm.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/amosjyng/zamm)

This is a literate programming code generation tool for the [Yin](https://crates.io/crates/zamm_yin) and [Yang](https://crates.io/crates/zamm_yang) crates.

It builds an intermediate code-generation binary from the provided Markdown file (`yin.md` by default) and runs the binary in the current directory.

## Install

```sh
cargo install zamm
```

Note that on Windows, you will need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/tree/5948898e54882c0bedd12d87569eb4dbee5bbca7#windows-msvc) to set up OpenSSL.
